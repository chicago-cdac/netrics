# FYI: Above we could've said:
#
#   param = {targets = [...]}
#
# ...but that'd be a long one-liner.
#
# TOML only lets our nested list split over multiple lines if we un-nest it,
# with the below implicitly-nested table.
#
# (YAML is of course quite different!
# ...And we support YAML configuration files as well.)

[ping.param]

    "netflix.com",

    "linkedin.com",

#
# And an empty top-level table is implied and may be omitted.
#
# That said, we *will* have settings to put there....
